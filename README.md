## 🧠 The Process

The purpose of this shopping cart app was to deepen my understanding of React hooks, focusing on writing clean, organized, and reusable component-based code to make future updates easier.

The first step was to fetch and display a list of available products from an external API. I then implemented filtering options based on price and category, allowing users to narrow down the products according to their preferences.

I also added the ability to view detailed information about each product, enhancing the user experience.

Additionally, I implemented a shopping cart where users can add selected products. The cart displays the chosen items, their quantities, and the total cost. All data is stored persistently using localStorage.
